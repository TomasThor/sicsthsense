	SicsthSense is based on the concept of <i>resources</i>, representing some type of 
	device or source of informtion. Data is then pulled or pushed from these resources
	to create <i>streams</i> of data. This data is stored by SicsthSense and made available for 
	further processing by you and others.
	<i>Resources</i> provide a definition of where and how
	a source of data is accessed, and then <i>streams</i> of data points are populated
	from this resource.
	<p>
	The first step is to <a href="/">create an account</a>. You can then add your own data resources
	and start collecting their data.  You can even track other people's resources.
	</p>

	<p>

<p>
The first step is to create an account. You can then add your data resources
and start collecting their data.  

<p>
<i>Resources</i> provide a definition of where and how
a source of data (e.g. a device or a website) is accessed. Data is then parsed
and recorded from this resource to populate<i>streams</i> of data points.
The resource can either be <a href="">polled by SicsthSense via an HTTP GET</a> on a specified URL, or the resource
pushes the data itself, via an <a href="#posting">HTTP POST to SicsthSense
	using the resource's key</a>.
</p>
<br />

<legend>Adding a resource</legend>

<p>
When adding a resource, all that is required is a unique <i>label</i>, so that the resource can
be uniquely named. If you would like SicsthSense to pull data from the resource, then you should also give it an URL to GET.
The interface looks as below, giving a simple form to create a new resoruce and a synopsis of already created resources.

<legend>Configuring a resource</legend>

<p>
Sics<sup>th</sup>Sense will attempt to parse a resource's data into useful information.
This can be performed automatically if the data is in JSON format and Content-Type.
After adding a resource, you can either click the "Auto add parsers" button, and the resource will
probe its polling URL and create a stream for each valid JSON primitive data type. These streams will
be hierarchically  organised into your <a href="">Streams</a> filesystem.
The same process will be performed upon the first POST to a resource's, if it does not yet contain any
parsers or data.
</p>

<br /> 

<p>
For example, the <i>light</i> and <i>humidity</i>
of the following resource would be stored by specifying the parsers
"<i>/sensors/light</i>" and "<i>/sensors/humidity</i>".  The values can
be either sent as an integer or float.
</p>
  <pre>
  {
    "name": "New device",
    "sensors": {
      "light": 4.3,
      "temperature": 15,
      "humidity": 45
    }
  }</pre>

Other data formats can be easily parsed by specifying a <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expression</a>
to capture relevant numbers from an external webpage.
Defining a regular expression 'group' will enable the parser to capture the relevant text.
More complex regular expressions, with multiple named groups, resulting in multiple named
stream output are also possible.

The easiest way to get your sensor data into Sics<sup>th</sup>Sense is to let us periodically <i>poll</i> your data resource (e.g. device or webpage).
This is solution is very flexible because it is entirely configured in the Cloud, through the Web interface.
After creating your resource, just discover or add new streams manually, with a corresponding polling interval.
The data will soon appear in graphs, and be available through our RESTful API.
Simply enter the URL that Sics<sup>th</sup>Sense should poll in the resource configuration page and the relevant
polling period.

  <h1 id='pollingDataHelp'>Posting data</h1>
	<a name="posting"></a>
Alternatively, you can perform HTTP POST's at the resource's Sics<sup>th</sup>Sense key URL. This can also be
found in the resource's configuration page. The POST request will be authorised by including the owner's <i>user token</i> in the query
string of the URL, e.g. "<i>POST [URL]?user_token=[userToken]</i>".
